# devtools-bridge-reaper.sh - stop unused attached chrome-devtools-axi bridges.
#
# Why: every chrome-devtools-axi session starts a bridge that detaches to init
# by design, plus a chrome-devtools-mcp child. The agent forgets
# `chrome-devtools-axi stop`, and the session that started it can end without
# it. On 2026-09-24 nine idle bridges, up to 98 hours old, held about 18 GB,
# almost all of it swap. With swap full the host sat near load 179 for six
# hours. mem-guardian never saw them: they are neither fleet repo processes nor
# agent panes.
#
# Scope: attached bridges only, CHROME_DEVTOOLS_AXI_BROWSER_URL set in the
# bridge's environment, as the fleet browser ladder sets it for every agent.
# chrome-autoprune refuses exactly those and stops the other, disposable ones.
# Every other bridge is skipped: a headed or persistent-profile bridge runs its
# own Chrome inside the tree.
#
# Idle signal: CPU time. A bridge serves every CLI command over its local port
# and forwards it to its MCP child, so a bridge nobody calls accumulates no
# CPU. Measured 2026-09-24 across 20 live bridges over 90 s: idle ones moved 0
# or 1 ticks, bridges in use moved 45 to 4400. Each run records the summed CPU
# ticks of the bridge's whole process tree. A run that sees the tree move more
# than NOISE_TICKS, or the session's own state files change, marks it busy. A
# bridge not busy for IDLE_MIN minutes is reaped. A bridge seen for the first
# time counts as busy at that moment, so nothing is reaped on its first run.
#
# A reaped bridge is cheap to get back: the next chrome-devtools-axi command in
# that session starts a fresh one. Only its MCP connection and page selection
# are dropped; the shared ladder browser keeps its pages and cookies.
#
# Reaping: TERM to the bridge, whose own handler closes its MCP client and
# signals its group; after a 5 s grace, KILL for whatever is left of that exact
# process tree. Every pid is re-validated by start time before it is
# signalled, so a recycled pid is never hit.
#
# Usage: devtools-bridge-reaper.sh [--dry-run]
#   --dry-run prints every attached bridge with its idle time and verdict, and
#   changes nothing (no signal, no state write).
# Runs every 10 minutes from flotilla-devtools-bridge-reaper.timer.
# Every reap: devtools-bridge-reaper.log here, one line in COMMS.md for the
# orchestrator, notify-master.sh when present.
