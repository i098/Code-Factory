# Keep a Firstmate checkout on branch main at upstream origin/main plus the
# patch layer in patches/firstmate/ (docs/dependencies.md#firstmate-patch-layer).
#
# usage: firstmate-patch-layer.sh apply|check|verify <checkout> <target> <patch-dir>
#   apply   move main to <target> + layer when needed; the last line is
#           "changed" or "unchanged"
#   check   the same decisions and refusals as apply, but move nothing
#   verify  exit 0 only when main is exactly <target> + layer
#
# The layer is built to one side, in a temporary index with git commit-tree, and
# main moves only once the whole layer exists: a patch that stops the run leaves
# the checkout as it was. Each commit takes its author, committer, date and
# message from the patch file, plus a Crewship-Patch trailer naming it, so
# one target and one set of patches always give the same sha. That is what makes
# an unchanged host a no-op.
