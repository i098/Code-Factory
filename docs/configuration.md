# Configuration

`.local/host.yml` is the single source of truth for one host. It is gitignored and owner-only (`0600`).

## Commands

| New name | Old name | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `./onboard.sh` | `./bootstrap.sh` | Installs the repository tooling: the latest uv, then the locked Python environment with Ansible. Changes nothing else on the host. |
| `./ship.sh dock` | | Copies `config/default.yml` to `.local/host.yml` with your user, home, and `~/Dev` workspace filled in. Never overwrites an existing file. Options: `--user`, `--home`, `--container`, and `--board`, which turns on the [crew board](board.md). |
| `./ship.sh inspect` | | Does the one-time config rewrite below if needed, then checks the config against `schemas/crewship.schema.json` and the cross-field rules below. |
| `./ship.sh chart` | | Runs the Ansible playbook in check mode. Reports what would change; mutates nothing except for the one-time config rewrite below. |
| `./ship.sh launch` | | Runs the playbook for real, after the one-time config rewrite below. Asks for the sudo password when passwordless sudo is not available. With the `firstmate` profile on, the first successful interactive apply with omp signed in then opens the new-host questions (below). |
| `./ship.sh survey` | | Checks that each expected tool runs and reports `gh` authentication. Changes nothing except for the one-time config rewrite below. |
| `scripts/ship.py` | | The Python program behind `ship.sh`. |
| `scripts/provisions.py` | `scripts/install_tools.py` | Installs the public tools into the user-owned Crewship prefix. |
| `scripts/stow-secrets.sh` | `scripts/push-super-env.sh` | Pushes `~/super.env` to Cloudflare Secrets Store and redeploys the fleet-secrets Worker. |
| `scripts/fetch-secrets.sh` | `scripts/fetch-super-env.sh` | Pulls `super.env` from the fleet-secrets Worker into `~/super.env`. |

`inspect`, `chart`, `launch`, and `survey` read `--config <path>` if you pass one, otherwise `.local/host.yml`. If `.local/host.yml` does not exist, `inspect`, `chart`, and `survey` fall back to `config/default.yml` (user `coder`); `launch` refuses to run.

The next config read rewrites an old root key to `crewship` and prints one notice.
It keeps the original bytes in `<config>.bak` beside the config.
The rewritten YAML does not keep comments; the backup keeps them.
Both files have owner-only permissions (`0600`).
The second read changes neither file.
The rewrite keeps unknown keys and values; schema validation still rejects unsupported keys.
If both root names or an existing backup are present, the command stops without changing the config.
Keep an existing backup and move it aside before you try the rewrite again.
Host paths, unit names, and the compose image name do not change in this step.

```

`inspect` also enforces these rules:

- `user` is not `root`, and `workspace` is inside `home`.
- `firstmate` and `browser_prune.enabled` need `agents`.
- `fleet_guards` needs `docker` and `firstmate`. Obscura is always its latest release. An older `.local/host.yml` that still sets `browsers.obscura_version` or `browsers.obscura_sha256` keeps working: both keys are deprecated, ignored, and reported in one warning on stderr. No edit is required.
- `ci_pool` needs `docker`, and no two `ci_pool.repos` entries may make the same unit name.
- `imessage` needs `firstmate`, and `imessage.owner` is a phone number in E.164 form (`+` and digits).
- `github_board` needs `firstmate`, `github_board.repo` is `owner/name`, and `github_board.project` is a Project number.
- `board` needs `firstmate` and `development`.

The Firstmate checkout tracks the default branch of upstream Firstmate, not a sha. Every apply fetches `origin/main` and puts `main` at that revision plus the [Firstmate patch layer](dependencies.md#firstmate-patch-layer), so tracking it is how a host stays current. Do not re-pin it to a sha. Each run resolves `origin/main` once and reports the sha it installed. To track a fork, set `firstmate.url` in `.local/host.yml`. The URL applies to a fresh clone; verification fails when an existing checkout's `origin` is a different URL, and provisioning never changes it for you. To switch an existing checkout, run `git -C <workspace>/firstmate remote set-url origin <url>` and `git -C <workspace>/firstmate fetch origin`, reconcile any local commits on `main` with `origin/main` by hand, then run `./ship.sh launch`.

## New-host questions

After a successful `./ship.sh launch` with the `firstmate` profile on, once omp has a provider login, Crewship starts omp in the Firstmate checkout with an opening prompt. Firstmate then asks the move decisions for this host one question at a time: which secondmate homes, services, tools, and unpushed work to bring over.

- The questions follow `firstmate.checklist` when it is set and `gh` can read it: `repo` is a GitHub repository (it can be private) and `path` is the checklist file in it. Set it only in `.local/host.yml`, never in `config/default.yml`. Otherwise they follow [Agent host move](agent-host-move.md).
- When `.local/host.yml` has no `github_board` block, the last question asks whether to turn on the [GitHub board](github-board.md). The answer is off unless you choose it.
- With the `development` profile on and no `board` block in `.local/host.yml`, one more question asks whether to turn on the [crew board](board.md). The answer is off unless you choose it.
- They are asked once per host. When the omp session exits successfully, apply writes the marker `~/.local/share/code-factory/new-host-questions-done`; while it exists, later applies skip the questions and print one line naming it. If omp exits non-zero, apply writes no marker and prints one line saying the questions did not complete. To ask again, delete the marker and rerun `./ship.sh launch` interactively.
- The launch needs an interactive terminal, run as `crewship.user`. When stdin is not a TTY, when `CI` is set, or when another account runs apply, apply skips them without writing the marker and prints one line saying to rerun `./ship.sh launch` interactively.
- They need an omp provider login. Apply checks with `omp models --json`; when it lists no models or fails, apply skips the questions without writing the marker and prints one line saying to sign in to omp with `/login` ([Sign in](omp.md#sign-in)) and rerun `./ship.sh launch` interactively. On a new host the first apply installs omp, so sign in after it and then rerun apply.

The recipe refuses to overwrite a conflicting unmanaged command or an independently advanced Firstmate checkout. See [Drift and upgrades](recovery.md#drift-and-upgrades).

## Profiles

| Profile | Default | What it installs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `agents` | on | omp, AXI tools, gh, no-mistakes, treehouse, gws (Google Workspace CLI; [sign-in](google-workspace.md) is manual), acpx; safe omp presentation and model-role settings (see [omp configuration](omp.md)); omp as the no-mistakes gate agent through the pi adapter with `acp:omp` as the fallback, or `acp:omp` alone when the adapter does not match the pins (see [no-mistakes pipeline agent](omp.md#no-mistakes-pipeline-agent)); first-write acpx config; the pattern-kill guard omp extension; `~/.local/bin/ponytail-review`; browser env defaults; Chrome autoprune timer. |
| `development` | on | Rust toolchain (stable), build essentials. |
| `firstmate` | on | Firstmate clone tracking upstream `main`, plus seeded Firstmate config: crew dispatch, crew and secondmate harness, the crew omp overlay (crew advisor, see [omp configuration](omp.md#advisor)), Herdr backend selection, startup memory budget, the spawn memory floor, presentation spaces off, and the turn-end pane-churn flag (see [Seeded Firstmate and OMP configuration](architecture.md#seeded-firstmate-and-omp-configuration)). |
| `docker` | on | Docker engine and Compose v2, with daemon defaults `init` (reaps orphaned children) and `live-restore`. Group membership is opt-in through the Ansible variable `crewship_docker_group_users`. |
| `fleet_guards` | off | Shared Supabase stack, Docker guard, dev-server reaper, devtools-bridge reaper, storage guard, env seeder. See [Fleet guards](fleet-guards.md). |
| `fleet_browsers` | off | The [browser ladder](fleet-guards.md#browser-ladder): the always-on Obscura CDP tier on `127.0.0.1:9222`, the on-demand `chrome` and `vnc` tiers with the `vnc` tier's TigerVNC and noVNC packages, the cookie sync and gc timers, and the ladder environment in shell profiles and the Herdr unit. `fleet_guards` provisions the same ladder, so a `fleet_guards` host needs no change. Needs no other profile; the ladder needs `iproute2` (`ss`) from the base image, which only `desktop` installs. |
| `chat` | on | The latest [Concord](https://github.com/chojs23/concord) (Discord) and [slk](https://github.com/gammons/slk) (Slack) terminal clients, their shared libraries, and a first-write config for each. Logins stay manual. See [Chat clients](chat.md). |
| `tailscale` | off | Tailscale daemon only. Authentication is manual; see [Security](security.md#remote-access). |
| `desktop` | off | Loopback-only XFCE + TigerVNC + noVNC operator desktop on `127.0.0.1:6080`, and the Google Chrome apt package. Needs an operator-created VNC password; see [Desktop access](recovery.md#desktop-access). |

The latest Herdr release is always installed, with the captured UI preferences, the [Spaces and Agents sidebar layouts](herdr.md) with the reporter timer that feeds Spaces, and one canonical, versioned user-service executable. What each profile installs, and where it comes from, is in [Dependencies](dependencies.md).

## Data disk

Set `data_dir` to an absolute path on a large data disk to keep fast-growing data off the system disk. The default `""` keeps today's layout.

| Data | Location with `data_dir` set | How |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Docker images, containers and volumes | `<data_dir>/docker` | `data-root` in `/etc/docker/daemon.json` (`docker` profile) |
| npm cache | `<data_dir>/cache/npm` | `npm_config_cache` |
| pip cache | `<data_dir>/cache/pip` | `PIP_CACHE_DIR` |

The variables go into the managed block of `~/.profile`, the Herdr unit and the no-mistakes daemon drop-in. A running Herdr server or no-mistakes daemon reads them only after its next restart. Apply creates `<data_dir>/cache` for the account; Docker creates its own data root. The cargo cache stays in `~/.cargo` on purpose: `CARGO_HOME` also holds `bin` and `config.toml`, so moving it would break `cargo install` on PATH and ignore the existing cargo config.

The bun, pnpm and uv caches stay on the system disk on purpose. These tools hardlink packages from their cache into each worktree's `node_modules` or `.venv`, and a hardlink works only on one filesystem. With the cache on another disk, each install copies full packages into the worktree, so the worktree pools grow faster on the system disk. Move these caches only together with the pools (see below).

### Moving an existing Docker data root

Apply sets the new `data-root` but copies nothing, so Docker starts with an empty root and pulls images again. Apply refuses the switch while a container runs, because `live-restore` cannot carry containers to a new root. To keep the images, volumes and stopped containers, move the root by hand before apply:

1. Make sure that `sudo docker ps -q` prints nothing. Do not stop containers that other work needs.
2. `sudo systemctl stop docker.socket docker.service`
3. `sudo rsync -aHAX /var/lib/docker/ <data_dir>/docker/`
4. Set `"data-root": "<data_dir>/docker"` in `/etc/docker/daemon.json`, or run `./ship.sh launch`.
5. `sudo systemctl start docker.service`, then make sure that `sudo docker info -f '{{.DockerRootDir}}'` and `sudo docker images` show the new root and the images.
6. Remove `/var/lib/docker` only after that check.

For a cache, copy it with `rsync -aHAX`, apply, check the new path (for example `npm config get cache`), then remove the old copy.

### Later: pools and hardlinking caches together

The worktree pools are the largest user of the system disk after Docker. Treehouse places new pools under `<root>/.treehouse`, where `<root>` comes from `--root`, the `TREEHOUSE_ROOT` variable, or `root` in a project's `treehouse.toml` (default `$HOME`). Treehouse looks up a pool under the same root, so a changed root does not find the pools that exist now. Change it only for a project whose pool has no live worktree. When the pools are on the data disk, point the bun (`BUN_INSTALL_CACHE_DIR`), pnpm (`store-dir`) and uv (`UV_CACHE_DIR`) caches to the same disk, so the hardlinks work again. The recipe does not do this step.
