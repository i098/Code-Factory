"""fleet/browsers/cookie-sync.ts never fans Google cookies out between tiers.

Three file-only tiers run the real sync without a browser. The vnc tier holds a
Google sign-in and a GitHub session; the canonical jar still carries a Google
cookie from an earlier sync. obscura holds a copy of vnc's Google session left
by the old fan-out, and chrome holds its own Google cookie with a different
value. After one sync the GitHub session reaches every tier, no Google cookie
is pushed, the replayed copy is gone from obscura, and chrome and vnc keep
their own Google cookies.
